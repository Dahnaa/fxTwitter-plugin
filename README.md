# FXTwitter

A custom **Vencord plugin** that automatically rewrites Twitter/X links into **FXTwitter** links — with **toggleable preview modes**.

I made this because typing `fxtwitter.com` every single time was annoying, so I decided to overengineer the solution instead 😭

## 👀 Features / Settings

- Automatically converts `twitter.com` / `x.com` links to `fxtwitter.com`
- Chat bar icon that toggles between modes
- Startup notification linking to the repository

## 🔗 Modes

# **Normal**
Uses the standard `fxtwitter.com` embed.

### **Domain**  
`d.fxtwitter.com`  

Directly links a post’s media without the full embed.

---

### **Gallery**  
`g.fxtwitter.com`  

Generate minimal embeds with just the post's media and author information without other distractions.

---

### **Text**  
`t.fxtwitter.com`  

Excludes photos and videos, showing only the post’s text.
